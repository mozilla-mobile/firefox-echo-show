# Echo Show device reference
    - Fire OS 5: Based on Android 5.1 (Lollipop, API level 22)
    - Fire OS 6: Based on Android 7.1 (Nougat, API level 25)

There are currently two devices:

| Gen | Release | Code  | OS | Size  | Resources | DPI  | Emulator  | Resolution |
|:---:|:-------:|:-----:|:--:|:-----:|:---------:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|
| 2nd | 2018    | AEOBP | 5  | 10.1" | xlarge    | mdpi | WXGA 10.1 | 1280x800   |
| 1st | 2017    | AEOKN | 5  | 7"    | large     | mdpi | ?         | 1024x600   |

We recommend **developing** on Android tablet emulators for developer efficiency: the recommended Android emulator images are mentioned above.

However, we ultimately recommend **verifying behavior** on device: the behavior on device differs from the emulator. Important note: **locally built apps cannot be installed on production Echo Show devices** so if you do not have a developer device, use the emulators.

### Known differences between Echo Show devices and Android tablet emulators
From a user experience perspective, we've noticed the following differences:
- Device notifications appear differently (we don't think there are any on Echo Show)
- Swiping from the top of the Echo Show screen will reveal a navigation bar including settings: this is different from the android settings and notification tray
- The bottom navigation view (back, home, recent apps) does not exist on the Echo Show
- The Echo Show supports some voice commands with Firefox such as, "Alexa, open Firefox" and emulators do not
- The Echo Show's physical screen has different pixel densities than the Android emulator, making the images look stretched in different ways

From an implementation perspective, we've noticed the following differences:
- `onStop` is not called when the device times out ([#172](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-echo-show/issues/172))
- If more than one WebView is created on the Echo Show device, the app will crash unlike Android

## Distinguishing devices in code
We distinguish devices using [the screen size metric][res size] from the Android resources system:
- All devices will use resources with no qualifiers (e.g. `layout`)
- You can target the 2nd generation Show by overriding the no qualifier resources with `xlarge` resources (e.g. `layout-xlarge`)

See the table above to see which screen size metric each device uses.

We use screen size because it's simple and less prescriptive compared to other resource metrics like `sw*dp` and `w*dp`.
