## Build instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-echo-show.git
```

2. Import the project into Android Studio or build on the command line:

  ```shell
  ./gradlew clean app:assembleAmazonWebviewDebug
  ```
3. Make sure to select the right build variant in Android Studio: **amazonWebviewDebug**

### Running
You can run from Android Studio or adb.

For recommendations on which devices and emulators to run on, see [device reference].

### Testing
To run a reasonable subset of the unit tests, we recommend:
```sh
./gradlew testAmazonWebViewDebug
```
To generate code coverage reports, run:
```sh
./gradlew -Pcoverage jacocoAmazonWebViewDebugTestReport
```
Reports can be found at
`app/build/jacoco/jacoco<buildVariant>TestReport/html/index.html`

### Pre-push hooks
Since we don't have CI, if you're pushing code, please add a pre-push hook. To use the
recommended hook, run this command from the project root:
```sh
ln -s ../../quality/pre-push-recommended.sh .git/hooks/pre-push
```

To push without running the pre-push hook (e.g. doc updates):
```sh
git push <remote> --no-verify
```

### Signing release builds
To build and sign a release build with our production keys using Autograph, run:
```sh
./tools/sign_release.sh
```

If you're not creating a release but want to create a release build for
local testing, you can append `--test` to ignore some release checks.

See that script's source for further usage.
