# Clean builds a release build and signs it with our release keys using the Autograph
# server. This script has no arguments. This script *MUST BE RUN FROM THE PROJECT ROOT.*
#
# To use this script, you'll need to create a <project-dir>/.autograph_config file
# with:
# ```
# AUTH_TOKEN=<autograph-auth-token>
# SERVER=<autograph-server-url-prod-or-staging>
# ```
#
# To get these credentials, contact the Cloud Services team.
#
# This script is based on the official Autograph documentation:
# https://mozilla.github.io/application-services/docs/applications/signing-android-apps.html
#
# For CI use, the documentation also links to a production TaskCluster configuration.
#
# If you're not creating a release but want to create a release build for local testing, you
# can append the `--test` flag to ignore some release checks.

# Strip unsigned content from the JAR. When running `apksigner verify`, most files in META-INF
# will give warnings that they're not protected by the signature. I could not figure out what
# these files are intended to do but removing them does not seem to affect the app. StackOverflow
# suggests removing the files entirely: https://stackoverflow.com/a/47394901 However, MANIFEST.MF,
# "The manifest file that is used to define extension and package related data." is protected by
# the signature so instead we remove everything else. More on MANIFEST.MF in JAR format:
# https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html
#
# This problem may not exist with APK signature scheme v2 but we use v1 (JAR signing) on Autograph.
